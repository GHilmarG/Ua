Once that method stagnates (which it almost always will because the gradient used in that method is just a rough estimate and generally not exact), switch to another minimisation approach, for example the UaOptimisation using the adjoint gradients.</p><p>Ua has some inbuilt optimisation methods and these are used by default.

The most general one is global remeshing using explicit error estimate</p><p>Global remeshing can be based on one or more of the following RefineCriteria:</p><div><ul><li>'effective strain rates'</li><li>'|dhdt|'</li><li>'||grad(dhdt)||'</li><li>'dhdt curvature'</li><li>'thickness gradient'</li><li>'thickness curvature'</li><li>'flotation'</li><li>'f factor'</li></ul></div><p>The criteria can be combined. When two or more criteria are combined RefineCriteria is given as a cell array</p><p>The relative importance of different RefineCriteria can be specified by defining `RefineCriteriaWeights'. These weights affect how small the smallest element will be for a given refinement criteria.</p><p>If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=1, the whole range CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin to CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax is used.</p><p>If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=0.5 element size will range from CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax down to CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin+(CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax-CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin)*(1-RefineCriteriaWeight)</p><p>If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=0 the criterion is effectively ignored.</p><p>Examples:</p><pre>CtrlVar.RefineCriteria='effective strain rates';  % specifies 'effective strain rates' as the only criterion
CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=[1];                % with a relative weight of unity</pre><pre>CtrlVar.RefineCriteria={'flotation','||grad(dhdt)||','dhdt curvature','thickness curvature'}; % several criteria used
CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=[1,1,1];  %</pre><p>In addition the refinement can be limited to an area within a given flotation distance by defining CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaFlotationLimit For example, for CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaFlotationLimit=[100,NaN] the first refinement criteria will only be applied to area where the glacier bed (b) is within 100 vertical distance units from flotation</p><p>One can also specify directly the desired element sizes (explicit:global option) or the elements to be refined (explicit:local option), using the user m-file `DefineDesireEleSizes.m'</p><p>Note: Adapt meshing can only be done in a combination with a forward run. Adapt meshing can not be done in an inverse run. Usually before starting with an inverse run you may find it usefull to do a number of forward (time independent) forward runs and use those to optimize the mesh prior to start of any inverse runs.</p><pre class="codeinput">CtrlVar.AdaptMesh=0;          <span class="comment">% true if adapt meshing is used, no remeshing is done unless this variable is true</span>

%% Numerical variables related to transient runs
% In general there should be no need to ever change these values except for testing purposes
%
% Transient runs can be done either (fully) implicitly, or semi-implicitly
% In a (fully) implicit approach, the time-integration is done implicitly with respect to both velocities and thickness.
% In a semi-implict approach, the time-integration is done implicitly with respect to thickness, and explicitly with respect to velocities.
%
% There are currently two fully-implicit time-stepping methods implemented: The 'theta' and the 'supg' methods.
%
% The 'theta' method uses a weighted sum of the values at the beginning and the end of a time step.
% The weighting is controlled by CtrlVar.theta and depending on the value of theta different types of
% approximations are obtained: 0,1/2,1 gives forward Euler, Lax-Wendroff and backwards Euler, respectively.
% The 'supg' method is a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin method. The supg-method uses the same
% weighting as the 'theta' method, but the test function for the mass-conservation equation is different.
%
% The default time-stepping method is: Fully implicit Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin with theta=0.5 (Lax Wendroff).

% Note: An additional time-stepping method is the Third-Order Taylor-Galerkin (TG3) method.
% It has not been fully tested but seems to work very well for fully implicit transient calculation.
% This option that can be obtained by setting:
% CtrlVar.TG3=1 ;  CtrlVar.Test1=1;  CtrlVar.Test0=0;   CtrlVar.theta=0.5;

%% Non-linear iteration-loop parameters
% The non-linear system is considered solved once the residuals are smaller than NLtol,
% and the normalised chances in u,h and \lambda smaller than du, dh and dl.
%
% The most (arguably even the only) important number is NLtol.
% NLtol is a tolerance on the norm of the solution residuals, i.e. the resulting residuals once the solution is
% plugged back into the equation. So NLtol should ALWAYS be set to a small value (for example <1e-10)
%
% The CtrlVar.du/dh/dl are tolerances for the chance in u,h, and \lambda, respectively, between subsequent non-linear iteration steps.
% Although one would expect these to go to zero with increasing iteration number, these are not very reliable
% estimates of the actual error.  Generally set du and dh to not too large value, but do not focus too much on those numbers
% (The error in solving the boundary conditions is always checked internally.)
CtrlVar.NLtol=1e-15; % tolerance for the square of the norm of the residual error
CtrlVar.du=1e-2;     % tolerance for change in (normalised) speed
CtrlVar.dh=1e-2;     % tolerance for change in (normalised) thickness
CtrlVar.dl=100;      % tolerance for change in (normalised) lambda variables used to enforced BCs
%    Note: there is no need to put any constrains on the Lagrange variables
%    used to enforce the BCs because 1) the BCs are currently always linear,
%    and 2) it is always checked internally that the BCs have been solved correctly.
%    In fact, it can be a bad idea to enforce a limit on this change because
%    sometimes the change in lambda between non-linear iteration steps is just a
%    direct response to how the primary variables (u,v,h) change.  The norm
%    of these changes can then be large despite the BCs being exactly fulfilled.)

% computational time.
%
% There are two criteria that determine if the left-hand side is updated or not:
% 1) interval and 2) (residual) reduction criteria. The interval criteria

%% Inversion 
%
% Inversion can currently be done for C and A. 
% 
% One can invert for either A or C, or both.
%
% The default option is to invert for log(A) and log(C) simultaneously.
%
% The objective function J (i.e. the function to be minimized) has the form
%
%  J=  I + R
%
% where I is a misift term, and R a regularisation term.
%
%
% The misfit term is:
%
%  I= (1/Area)   \int  (((u-uMeas)/uErrors)^2 + ((v-vMeas)/vErrors)^2) ) dx dy
%
% and the regularisation term can be either (Bayesian)
%
%  R= (C-Cprior) inv(KC) (C-Cprior)  +  (A-Aprior) inv(KA) (A-Aprior)  
%
% where KC and KA are covariance matrices, or (Tikhonov)
%
%  R= (1/Area)  \int (  gs^2 (grad (p-prior))^2  + ga^2 (p-prior)^2) dx dy
%
% where p is A or log(A), C or log(C)
%
% There are number of different minimisation methods implemented. Although the
% methodology behind the inversion is rigorous, in practice when working with
% real data the inversions sometimes get stuck in some local minima. The
% different optimisations methods implemented use slighlty different search
% directions, and switching methods may help getting out of a local minima as
% seen by one particular method. (When using synthetic data this is hardly ever
% an issue).
%
%
% The inversion for C and A can be done with C and A defined on nodes or
% elements. See: CtrlVar.AGlenisElementBased and CtrlVar.CisElementBased.
% In the past only inversion for element-based variables was possible, but now
% one can invert for either nodal or element values. By default, the inversion
% is done on nodal values. 
%
%
% Hint: Often starting inverting for C using the fix-point method (see
% "FixPointEstimationOfSlipperiness" below) drives the misfit initially quite
% significantly down. Once that method stagnates (which it almost always will
% because the gradient used in that method is just a rough estimate and
% generally not exact), switch to another minimisation approach, for example the
% UaOptimisation using the adjoint gradients.
%
% Ua has some inbuilt optimisation methods and these are used by default.
% However, if the matlab optimisation toolbox is installed, the matlab routines
% can be used instead.
%
% Note #1: Some parameter combinations can be inconsistent. For example inverting
% for A only and applying regularisation on A and C, i.e.
%
%   CtrlVar.Inverse.InvertFor='logAGlen' ;
%   CtrlVar.Inverse.Regularize.Field='logAGlenlogC'
%
% is considered inconsistent (although in principle possible.) Also using the
% `FixPointC' gradient calculation, which only works for C inversion, and
% inverting for both A and C, i.e. 
%
%   CtrlVar.Inverse.DataMisfit.GradientCalculation='Adjoint' ; % {'Adjoint','FixPointC'}
%   CtrlVar.Inverse.InvertFor='logAGlenlogC' ; % {'C','logC','AGlen','logAGlen','logAGlenlogC'}
%
% is inconsistent. Ua tries to spot these input parameter mistakes and correct
% for them, but it is better to try to keep all inputs consistent.
%
% Note #2: It is possible to invert for any combinatin of log(A) or A  and log(C)
% or C. So for example one can invert for log(A) and C by setting 
%
%   CtrlVar.Inverse.InvertFor='logAGlenC' ;
%
% Also one can invert for log(C) and log(A) and regularise A and C by setting
%
%
%   CtrlVar.Inverse.InvertFor='logAGlenlogC' ;

%% General Meshing Options
% There are various ways of meshing the computational domain.
%
% In almost all cases the simplest option tends to be to define the outlines of the computational domain in Ua2D_InitialUserInput.
% In that case Úa will call an external mesh generator.
% The external mesh generator used by Ua is "gmsh" which is a well known and well supported open source mesh generator (http://geuz.org/gmsh/)
% The outlines of the mesh are defined by the variable 'MeshBoundaryCoordinates' set in Ua2D_InitialUserInput.m. This approach is quite flexible
% and allows for complicated computational domains containing holes and/or separated domains.
%
% *For examples of how to generate different type of meshes look at* *ExamplesOfMeshGeneration.m*
%
% Both when done from within Úa or externally, generating a FE mesh with the mesh generator `gmsh' typically involves:
%
% *             a) create an input file for gmsh (.geo)
% *             b) call gmsh for that input file (.geo). gmsh in turn generates an output file (.msh)
% *             c) read into Úa the resulting gmsh output file (.msh) with the mesh
% All, or some of these three steps can be done withing Úa.
%
% More specifically the options are:
%
% *    i)  Directly read existing gmsh output file (.msh)
% *   ii)  First run gmsh with an existing gmsh input file (.geo) and then read the resulting gmsh output file (.msh)
% *   iii) First generate gmsh input file (geo), then run gmsh for that input file, and finally read the resulting gmsh output file (.msh)
%
% Option iii is the default option, in which case Úa generates the gmsh input file (.geo), calls gmsh, and then reads the resulting gmsh output file with the mesh.
%
% To select between i, ii and iii set CtrlVar.GmshMeshingMode={'load .msh','mesh domain and load .msh file','create new gmsh .geo input file and mesh domain and load .msh file'}
%
% CtrlVar.GmshMeshingMode='load .msh'                                                               % option i
% CtrlVar.GmshMeshingMode='mesh domain and load .msh file'                                          % option ii
 CtrlVar.GmshMeshingMode='create new gmsh .geo input file and mesh domain and load .msh file';    % option iii, which is the default option
%

%% Pos. thickness constraints,          (-active set-)

%  2) `active-set' method.
%  3) `thickness-barrier' method
%
% The active-set method is the preferred option and is arguably the only correct way of enforcing min ice thickness.
% The active-set method should therefore be used whenever possible.
% However, in some cases the active set method does not converge, in which case
% options 1) or 3), or combinations thereof, must be used.  If the differences between approach 1) and 2) are small, then using 1)
% allows for shortest computation times
%
% The thickness-barrier method introduces a fictitious surface mass balance term.
% The thickness-barrier method can be used on its own, but should primarily be used in combination with the active-set method
% to improve convergence.

CtrlVar.RefineMeshOnRestart=0;
CtrlVar.RefineMeshOnStart=0;
%% Mesh refinement: Global and local adaptive mesh refinement
% There are various adapt meshing options.
% The most general one is global remeshing using explicit error estimate
%
% Global remeshing can be based on one or more of the following
% RefineCriteria:
%
% * 'effective strain rates'
% *          '|dhdt|'
% *        '||grad(dhdt)||'
% *          'dhdt curvature'
% *         'thickness gradient'
% *         'thickness curvature'
% *         'flotation'
% *         'f factor'
%
% The criteria can be combined. When two or more criteria are combined
% RefineCriteria is given as a cell array
%
% The relative importance of different RefineCriteria can be specified by
% defining `RefineCriteriaWeights'. These weights affect how small the smallest
% element will be for a given refinement criteria.
%
% If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=1, the whole range CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin to
% CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax is used.
%
% If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=0.5 element size will range from
% CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax down to
% CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin+(CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax-CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin)*(1-RefineCriteriaWeight)
%
% If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=0 the criterion is effectively ignored.
%
% Examples:
%
%  CtrlVar.RefineCriteria='effective strain rates';  % specifies 'effective strain rates' as the only criterion
%  CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=[1];                % with a relative weight of unity
%
%  CtrlVar.RefineCriteria={'flotation','||grad(dhdt)||','dhdt curvature','thickness curvature'}; % several criteria used
%  CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=[1,1,1];  %
%
% In addition the refinement can be limited to an area within a given flotation distance by defining
% CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaFlotationLimit
% For example, for CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaFlotationLimit=[100,NaN]
% the first refinement criteria will only be applied to area where the glacier bed (b) is within 100 vertical distance units from flotation
%
% One can also specify directly the desired element sizes (explicit:global
% option) or the elements to be refined (explicit:local option), using the user
% m-file `DefineDesireEleSizes.m'
%
% Note: Adapt meshing can only be done in a combination with a forward run.
% Adapt meshing can not be done in an inverse run. Usually before starting with
% an inverse run you may find it usefull to do a number of forward (time
% independent) forward runs and use those to optimize the mesh prior to start of
% any inverse runs.

% `explicit:global' implies a global remeshing of the whole domain. This is a very flexible approach 
%  allowing for both increasing and decreasing mesh resolution.
% 'explicit:local' implies a local adaptive mesh refinement obtained by splitting

%% Adaptive Time Stepping Algorithm (ATSA)   (adapt time step)

% This is a simple but highly effective method.  However, as the ATSA is not based on any kind of error estimates,
% it does not guarantee that errors will not accumulate, etc, and ATSA does not work for linear problems.
%
% The main idea is to aim at a time step that limits the number of non-linear iteration to a relatively small number.
% If so, then most likely the Newton-Raphson iteration is in the quadratic regime.
% Experience has shown that a target number of iterations (CtrlVar.ATSTargetIterations) within 3 to 5 is good for this purpose
%
% Time step is increased if r<1 where
%

%     M=CtrlVar.ATSTargetIterations
%   and
%     n=CtrlVar.ATSintervalUp
%
%   (N does not need to be specified.)

%        b) number of iterations over last n times steps were all larger than 10
%  where n=CtrlVar.ATSintervalDown
%
% There are some further modifications possible:
%  -time step is adjusted so that time interval for making transient plots (CtrlVar.TransientPlotDt) is not skipped over
