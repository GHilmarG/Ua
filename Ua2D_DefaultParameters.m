function CtrlVar=Ua2D_DefaultParameters


%% Running Úa:
%
% 1) Add the folder with the Úa m-files, and its subfolders, to your matlab path.
%    This can be done using the 'Home/Set' Path menu item, or from the
%    command prompt doing something like:
%    addpath('MyUaSourceFileFolder')
%
% 2) Define the Matlab environmental variable 'UaHomeDirectory'.
% This can for example be done as follows:
%                 setenv('UaHomeDirectory','MyUaSourceFileFolder')
%
% 3) If using the mesh generator `gmsh' (almost always the case) then also define 
% the Matlab environmental variable 'GmeshHomeDirectory'. The gmsh program
% can be found below the Úa main folder, so something like
%                 setenv('GmeshHomeDirectory','MyDrive/Ua2D/gmsh-2.8.4-Windows')  
% will do. Alternativily you might want to install your own copy of gmsh.
% If running on a Unix system, then most likely gmsh can be called without the need
% to set the Matlab environmental variable 'GmeshHomeDirectory'. 
%
% Now you can run Úa from within Matlab by writing Ua2D [Ret]
%
%
%% Defining model run
% Whenever setting up your own model, create your own working directory for your model runs. 
% Most of the parameters of a given model run are defined by the user through m-files 
% called by Úa during the run. 
%
% These m-files are:
% DefineAGlenDistribution.m
% DefineSlipperyDistribution.m
% DefineBoundaryConditions.m  (also possible to use the more limited but easier to use `DefineBCs.m' instead)          
% DefineGeometry.m                
% DefineDensities.m          
% DefineMassBalance.m
%
% Optionally one can also define start values for (u,v) using:
% DefineStartVelValues.m
%
% If adaptive meshing is used, then optionally one can define desired ele sizes using 'DefineDesiredEleSize.m'
% However, Úa also has various automated in-built options of specifying ele sizes based on various criteria and
% in many cases one does not need to do any further modifications.
%
% If used in an inverse mode then 'DefineInverseModellingVariables.m' is required.
%
% If any of the above listed m-Files are not found in the run directory, the corresponding m-Files in the Úa home directory are used instead.
%
% When defining a new model-run, just copy these files from the Úa home directory into your own model-run directory 
% and modify as needed. 
% 
% The calls to these functions are: 
% [rho,rhow,g]=DefineDensities(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,time,s,b,h,S,B);
% 
% [C,m]=DefineSlipperyDistribution(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,time,s,b,h,S,B,rho,rhow,GF);
% 
% [AGlen,n]=DefineAGlenDistribution(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,time,s,b,h,S,B,rho,rhow,GF);
% 
% [as,ab]=DefineMassBalance(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,time,s,b,h,S,B,rho,rhow,GF);
% or if mass-balance geometry feedback option 3 is used:
% [as,ab,dasdh,dabdh]=DefineMassBalance(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,time,s,b,h,S,B,rho,rhow,GF); 
% 
% BCs=DefineBoundaryConditions(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,BCs,time,s,b,h,S,B,ub,vb,ud,vd,GF)
% BCs is an instant of the class `BoundaryConditions' which in fact is just a simple structure with a number of fields. 
% To see the fields of BCs have a look at BoundaryConditions.m 
% The fancy way of doing this is to do: publish('BoundaryConditions.m') ; web('html\BoundaryConditions.html')
% from the Ua home directory.
%
% Alternativily, instead of `DefineBoundaryConditioins' one can use:
% [ufixednode,ufixedvalue,vfixednode,vfixedvalue,utiedA,utiedB,vtiedA,vtiedB,hfixednode,hfixedvalue,htiedA,htiedB]=...
%     DefineBCs(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,time,s,b,h,S,B,ub,vb,ud,vd,GF);
% 
% [s,b,S,B,alpha]=DefineGeometry(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,time,FieldsToBeDefined);
% 
% [ub,vb,ud,vd]=DefineStartVelValues(Experiment,CtrlVar,MUA,ub,vb,ud,vd,time,s,b,h,S,B,rho,rhow,GF,AGlen,n,C,m);
%  
% [ub,vb,ud,vd]=StartVelocity(CtrlVar,MUA);

%% Numerical variables related to transient runs
% In general there should be no need to ever change these values except for testing purposes
%
% Transient runs can be done either (fully) implicitly, or semi-implicitly
% In a (fully) implicit approach, the time-integration is done implicitly with respect to both velocities and thickness.
% In a semi-implict approach, the time-integration is done implicity with respect to thickness, and explicitly with respect to velocities.
%
% There are currently two fully-implicit time-stepping methods implemented: The 'theta' and the 'supg' methods.
%
% The 'theta' method uses a weighted sum of the values at the beginning and the end of a time step.
% The weighting is controled by CtrlVar.theta and depending on the value of theta different types of
% approximations are obtained: 0,1/2,1 gives forward Euler, Lax-Wendroff and backwards Euler, respectivily.
% The 'supg' method is a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin method. The supg-method uses the same
% weighting as the 'theta' method, but the test function for the mass-conservation equation is different.
%
% The default time-stepping method is: Fuly implicit Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin with theta=0.5 (Lax Wendroff).
%
%
CtrlVar.Implicituvh=1;           % 0: prognostic run is semi-implicit (implicit with respect to h only)

% Note: An additional time-stepping mehtod is the Third-Order Taylor-Galerkin (TG3) method.
% It has not been fully tested but seems to work very well for fully implicit transient calculation.
% This option that can be obtained by setting:
% CtrlVar.TG3=1 ;  CtrlVar.Test1=1;  CtrlVar.Test0=0;   CtrlVar.theta=0.5;

%% Non-linear iteration-loop parameters
% The non-linear system is considered solved once the residuals are smaller than NLtol,
% and the normalised chances in u,h and \lambda smaller than du, dh and dl.
%
% The most (arguably even the only) important number is NLtol.
% NLtol is a tolerance on the norm of the actual solution residuals, i.e. the resulting residuals once the solution is
% plugged back into the equation. So NLtol should ALWAYS be set to a small value (for example <1e-10)
%
% The CtrlVar.du/dh/dl are tolerances for the chance in u,h, and \lambda, respectively, between non-linear iterations.
% Although one would expect these to go to zero with increasing iteration number, these are not very reliable
% estimates of the actual error.  Generally set du and dh to not too large value, but do not focus too much on those numbers
% (The error in solving the boundary conditions is always checked internally.)
CtrlVar.NLtol=1e-15; % this is the square of the error, i.e. not root-mean-square error
CtrlVar.du=1e-2;     % tolerance for change in (normalised) speed
CtrlVar.dh=1e-2;     % tolerance for change in (normalised) thickness
CtrlVar.dl=100;      % tolerance for change in (normalised) lambda variables used to enforced BCs
%    Note: there is no need to put any constrains on the Lagrange variables
%    used to enforce the BCs because 1) the BCs are currently always linear,
%    and 2) it is always checked internally that the BCs have been solved correctly.
%    In fact it can be a bad idea to enforce a limit on this chance.
%    (Sometimes the change in lambda between non-linear iteration steps is just a
%    direct response to how the primary variables (u,v,h) change.  The norm
%    of these changes can then be large despite the BCs being exactly fulfilled.)

%% Meshing
% There are various ways of meshing the computational domain.
%
% The simplest option tends to be to use the external mesh generator `gmsh' directly from within Úa
% If that is done, only the outlines of the mesh need to be defined in the variable 'MeshBoundaryCoordinates'
% and the variables CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin and CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax set. However there are various other options.
%
%  For examples of how to generate different type of meshes look at `ExamplesOfMeshGeneration.m'
%
%
% The main Options are:
%
% # Read the initial FE mesh (coordinates, connectivity) directly into Ua from a previously generated .mat file:
%   (set CtrlVar.ReadInitialMesh to true)
% # Use `mesh2d.m' to generate the mesh (set CtrlVar.MeshGenerator='mesh2d')
% # Use `gmesh'  to generate the mesh (set CtrlVar.MeshGenerator='gmesh')
%
% Note: mesh2d is excellent, but unfortunately does not work with matlab2011b or later.
% Therefore `gmesh' is at the moment the best option to use.
%
% In general using `gmesh' involves:
% *             a) creating an inputfile for gmesh (.geo)
% *             b) calling gmesh for that input file
% *             c) reading the resulting gmesh output file (.msh) with the mesh
% All, or some of these three steps can be done withing Úa.
%
% When using gmesh it is possible to select between these option:
%
% *    i)  Directly read existing gmesh output file (.msh)
% *   ii)  First run gmesh with an existing gmesh input file (.geo) and then read the resulting gmesh output file (.msh)
% *   iii) First generate gmesh input file (geo), then run gmesh for that input file, and finally read the resulting gmesh output file (.msh)
%
% To select between 3i and 3iii set CtrlVar.GmeshMeshingMode={'load .msh','mesh domain and load .msh file','create new gmesh .geo input file and mesh domain and load .msh file'}
%
% In most cases running gmesh from within Úa is the simplest way of meshing the domain.
% Only the outlines of the domain need to be defined as well as a few parameters that control
% the element sizes.

%% Pos. thickness constraints,          (-active set-)
% A minimum ice thickness can be enforced in different ways using the following methods:
%  1) `reset method' : simply resetting the thickness to min thickness at node where thickness is less than a prescribed value.
%  2) `active-set' method.
%  3) `thickness-barrier' method
%
% The active-set method is the preferred option and is arguably the only correct way of enforcing min ice thickness.
% The active-set method should therefore be used whenever possible.
% However, in some cases the active set method does not converge, in which case
% options 1) or 3), or combinations thereof, must be used.  If the differences between approach 1) and 2) are small, then using 1)
% allows for shortest computation times
%
% The thickness-barrier method introduces a fictitious surface mass balance term.
% The thickness-barrier method can be used on its own, but should primarily be used in combination with the active-set method
% to improve convergence.

%% Global adaptive mesh refinement  , adapt mesh 
% There are various adapt meshing options.
% The most general one is global remeshing using explicit error estimate
%
% Global remeshing can be based on one or more of the following
% RefineCriteria:
%           'effective strain rates'
%           '|dhdt|'
%           '||grad(dhdt)||'
%           'dhdt curvature'
%           'thickness gradient'
%           'thickness curvature'
%           'flotation'
%           'f factor'
% the criteria can be combined.
% When two or more criteria are combined RefineCriteria is given as a cell array
%
% The relative importance of different RefineCriteria can be specified by defining `RefineCriteriaWeights'
% These weights affect how small the smallest element will be for a given refinement criteria.
%
% If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=1, the whole range CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin to CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax is used
%
% If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=0.5 element size will range from
% CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax down to CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin+(CtrlVar.MeshSizeMax-CtrlVar.MeshSizeMin)*(1-RefineCriteriaWeight)
%
% If CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=0 the criterion is effectively ignored
%
% Examples:
%
%  CtrlVar.RefineCriteria='effective strain rates';  % specifies 'effective strain rates' as the only criterion
%  CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=[1];                % with a relative weight of unity
%
%  CtrlVar.RefineCriteria={'flotation','||grad(dhdt)||','dhdt curvature','thickness curvature'}; % several criteria used
%  CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaWeights=[1,1,1];  %
%
% In addition the refinement can be limited to an area within a given flotation distance by defining
% CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaFlotationLimit
% For example, for CtrlVar.RefineCriteriaFlotationLimit=[100,NaN]
% the first refinement criteria will only be applied to area where the glacier bed (b) is within 100 vertical distance units from flotation

%% Adaptive Time Stepping Algorithm (ATSA)   (adapt time step)
% The adaptive-time-stepping algorithm is based on the idea of keeping the number of non-linear iterations
% close to a certain target (CtrlVar.ATSTargetIterations).
% This is a simple but highly effective method.  However, as the ATSA is not based on any kind of error estimates,
% it does not guarantee that errors will not accumulate, etc, and ATSA does not work for linear problems.
%
% The main idea is to aim at a time step that limits the number of non-linear iteration to a relatively small number.
% If so, then most likely the Newton-Raphson iteration is in the quadratic regime.
% Experience has shown that a target number of iterations (CtrlVar.ATSTargetIterations) within 3 to 5 is good for this purpose
%
% Time step is increased if r<1 where
%
%     r=N/M
%
%   where
%   N is the max number of non-linear iteration over last n time steps
%   M is the target number of iterations
%
%   here
%     M=CtrlVar.ATSTargetIterations
%   and
%     n=CtrlVar.ATSintervalUp
%
%   (N does not need to be specified.)
%
%  Currently the time step is only decreased if either:
%        a) the number of non-linear iterations in last time step was larger than 25
%        b) number of iterations over last n times steps were all larger than 10
%  where n=CtrlVar.ATSintervalDown
%
% There are some further modifications possible:
%  -time step is adjusted so that time interval for making transient plots (CtrlVar.TransientPlotDt) is not skipped over
%  -time step is not increased further than the target time step CtrlVar.ATStimeStepTarget
%  -time step is adjusted so that total simulation time does not exceed CtrlVar.TotalTime
